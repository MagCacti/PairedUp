/*
  Room accepts the following dependencies:

$rootScope - it is used in order to invoke the $digest loop, once socket.io event is received. Since the socket.io event handlers are not wrapped inside $scope.$appy we need to invoke $digest manually.

$q - in order to provide promise based interface

Io - the wrapped socket.io global function

config - the configuration constant we defined in app.js.
