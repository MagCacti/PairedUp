  RoomCtrl accepts as dependencies the following components:
$sce - used for setting the source of the video elements
VideoStream - used for getting the video stream from the user's camera
$location - used for redirecting the user to the room's URL
$routeParams - used for getting the room id
$scope - used for attaching data to it in order to achieve data-binding with the view
Room - service which we are going to define next. It is used for managing the peer connections.
